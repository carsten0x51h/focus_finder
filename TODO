-NEXT

	-Store recorded curve on disk (as part of profile)
	-Impl. operator<< for enums using asStr()?
	-Handle cancel exception in "focus curve recorder" and "focus finder"
	-Remove hardcoded exposure times (e.g. in focus curve recorder -> maybe this field should be inegrated also into the focus curve recorder frame!)
	-Recorder should listen to position events from focuser -> draw a line of current position...
	-Use stored focus curve / function from prifle in focus finder
	-Should Hfd, Fwhm vert, Fwhm horz all be calculated right after recording (during the recording process), or just the one which is needed??
	-AboutDialog -> draw program version on image!
	-On INDI-Server disconnect (or camera disconnect, or camera device removal), stop exposure

	-Extend curve fitting so that certain parameters can be "fixed" (-> difficult / more effort)

	-Use boost log to filter out logs by component (-> different channels?), 

-MainWindow
	-Selected POI should overwrite ROI?! (if both are selected?)
	-Fully integrate FocusFinderExecutor + actual FocusFinder with events (?)

-ManageDeviceProfilesDialog
	-Implement New + edit profile -> see libreoffice document...
		-Extend persistence of boost tree to SizeT, enums etc. 
	-ProfileManager - Add directory listener to get notified when profile was added or removed (same as renamed). 
	-Späääter, im cfg dialog hinter jedes Feld ein blaues Info Icon mit Mouse-over text zum Erklären der FUnktion.....?!
	-Später: Im cfg. Dialog einige Dinge "visualisieren" - z.B. Star window mit Grafik und Stern, das sich je nach Window size verändert....
	-Close ManageDeviceProfilesDialog if MainWindow is closed

-Focus / FocusCntlPanel
	-Idea! Also mFfl should allow registering to an event that is fired when focus finder process
	 has started! Then this panel can be disabled (same for camera cntl panel).
    -IDEA: In focus cntl panel - maybe indicate absolute position of focus by a line and a dot where left is minimu, right is maximum and dot is the current position... but maybe this should go to a sep panel...
    -Add listener - when temperature has changed...
    -FocusCntlPanel - listen for up/down arrow key -> move focus up / down 1 step (or maybe 10 steps)... page up, page down also (10x more..)

-Cooler device simulator
-Integrate into UI
-Finish device dialog to connect devices
-Impl. first indi device against device IF

-Implement binning - dummy camera, selection in GUI, etc.
-3D star profile - see example
